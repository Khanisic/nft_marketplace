# NFT Marketplace

<p>Hey guys, Khanisic/Abdul Moid Khan here 👋.</p>
<br/>
<p>Welcome to the NFT Marketplace where you can upload your images and watch them turn into NFTs. Here, you can trade your NFTs with other creators.</p>
<br/>
<p>I have used <i>Next.js - A fullstack react framework,</i> to build the project deployed it on vercel. For the smart contract deployment, I've used hardhat and used MATIC to power the smart contract!</p>
